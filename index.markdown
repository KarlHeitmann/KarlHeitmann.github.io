### **Hi!**


Iâ€™m overhauling my website.

Click <a href="https://karlheitmann.github.io/karlheitmann_legacy/" target="_blank">here</a> to visit my legacy website. I built that site from scratch using Jekyll and SASS.

I am using <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">minima</a> as a starting point for my current website. Up until now I've built [my CV]({% link pages/cv/index.markdown %}). I'm open to work.
