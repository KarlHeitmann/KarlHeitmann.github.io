### **Hi!**


Iâ€™m overhauling my website.

Don't worry, my legacy web page contains much more fun stuff. As soon as I finish setting up my <a href="https://github.com/KarlHeitmann/karlheitmann_legacy" target="_blank">legacy personal web page</a> deployment, I'll link it here.

In the meantime, you can check out my new CSS style by clicking [this link to my CV]({% link pages/cv/index.markdown %}).

Yes!

I'm open to work!

That's the reason why I'm reviewing my website: I'm lazy and I only do what is necessary to do.
